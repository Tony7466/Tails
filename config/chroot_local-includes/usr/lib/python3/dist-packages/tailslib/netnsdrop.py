This module is useful for all those scripts that are meant to run a specific application inside a network namespace.

This functions make many assumptions about the working of it; that's in the hope that those scripts will keep
a somewhat similar structure. This is:
    - the netns has already been created, of course
    - somewhere in /etc/sudoers.d/ the wrapper can be run as root
    - the systemd user unit tails-a11y-bus-proxy is running
