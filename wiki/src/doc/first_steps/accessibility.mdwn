[[!meta title="Accessibility"]]

Tails and the GNOME desktop include assistive technologies to support users
with various impairments and special needs, and to interact with common
assistive devices.

[[!toc]]

<h1 id="menu">Accessibility menu</h1>

You can activate several assistive technologies, like a screen reader or large
text, from the accessibility menu in the top bar, the
[[!img lib/accessibility.png alt="accessiblity menu" class="symbolic" link="no"]]
icon that looks like a person.

[[!img desktop/accessibility.png link="no" class="screenshot"
alt="Accessibility menu with the following options, all disabled
by default: High Contrast, Zoom, Large Text, Screen Reader, Screen Keyboard,
Visual Alters, Sticky Keys, Slow Keys, Bounce Keys, and Mouse Keys"]]

These technologies are documented in more details in
[GNOME Help: Accessibility](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/a11y.html).

<h1 id="keyboard">Screen keyboard</h1>

If you prefer a pointing device over the keyboard, turn on the **Screen
Keyboard** from the accessibility menu ([[!img lib/accessibility.png
alt="accessiblity menu" class="symbolic" link="no"]]).

<div class="tip">

<p>You can also use the screen keyboard to protect against hardware keyloggers
by avoiding to use the actual keyboard.</p>

<p>If a keylogger has been physically installed on the computer, your
passwords, personal information, and other data typed on the keyboard could be
stored and accessed by someone else, even if you are using Tails.</p>

<p>For an example, see
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJo8qCYE8M">KeeLog: KeyGrabber
forensic keylogger getting started</a>.</p>

<p>Keyloggers are more likely on public computers, in internet cafés or
libraries, and on desktop computers, where a device is easier to hide.</p>
